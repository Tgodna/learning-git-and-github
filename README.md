# Learning Git and GitHub with Python Projects

Welcome to my **Learning Git and GitHub** repository! ðŸŽ‰ This project showcases my journey of learning Python, Git, and GitHub. Inside, youâ€™ll find various Python projects Iâ€™ve worked on while learning the basics of programming.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python projects where I applied core concepts learned in the following areas:
- **Python Basics**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and more.
- **Version Control with Git**: How to track changes in code, collaborate with others, and use Git commands to manage my projects.
- **GitHub**: How to host and share my code using GitHub, set up repositories, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Projects Included

Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to a different Python project or exercise that I completed during my learning process. Some examples of what you might find here:
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors game**: A simple console game demonstrating Python conditionals and loops.
- **Meme Bot**: A simple Discord bot that fetches memes using an API, showcasing Python and the `discord.py` library.
- **Slot Machine**: A basic slot machine game built using Python's random module. Spin the reels and see if you hit the jackpot!
